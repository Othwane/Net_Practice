# NetPractice

## Project Overview

NetPractice is an introductory project designed to help you understand and practice fundamental networking concepts. Through a browser-based simulation, you will configure small-scale networks by solving various addressing and connectivity problems.

## Project Objectives

- Understand basic networking concepts such as IP addressing, routing, and connectivity.
- Configure network diagrams to establish correct communications between devices.
- Complete and submit configurations for 10 exercises.

## Setup Instructions

1. Download the file from the project page.
2. Extract the files into a directory of your choice.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to launch the training interface.
4. Enter your login when prompted. This is important for generating identifiable configuration files.
5. Start practicing.

## Exercise Format

- There are 10 levels (exercises) to complete.
- Each level presents a broken network diagram with a specific goal.
- Adjust the configurations (IP addresses, masks, routes, etc.) to make the network functional.
- Use the **[Check again]** button to verify your configuration.
- Once completed, use the **[Get my config]** button to export your result.
- Logs at the bottom of the page can help debug issues.

> Important: Always export your configuration before moving to the next level.

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit 10 configuration files (one for each level) at the root of your Git repository.
- Make sure each configuration file corresponds to a level completed with your login set in the interface.
- Only the files in your repository will be evaluated.

## Evaluation Notes

- During the defense, you will be asked to complete 3 randomly selected levels.
- You will have limited time to solve each.
- No external tools are allowed during the defense, except a basic calculator such as `bc`.

## Learning Goals

- Practice TCP/IP addressing and subnetting
- Understand routing and network device behavior
- Debug misconfigured networks using practical simulation

This project will reinforce your understanding of theoretical networking concepts through hands-on simulations.
